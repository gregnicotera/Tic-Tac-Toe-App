# Tic-Tac-Toe-App

Group project for #100Devs. Goal was to get Tic Tac Toe Game operational and store elements in object. Learned a few things
like how to set up a win condition using 2D array. Also learned you have set up a click event and have the function
get the target info e/o using the "event" function directly in the click event.
